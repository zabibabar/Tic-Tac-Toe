# test.py
A test script* for the tic-tac-toe game.

## Usage Example

```
python test.pyc tictactoe test1.txt
```

where `tictactoe` is the name of your program and `test1.txt` is a text file describing a test case.

A test case must have the following format:

```
EXPECTED WINNER
INPUTS TO THE PROGRAM
```

where EXPECTED WINNER is one line with the number 0, 1, or 2 (0 indicates the game must end in a draw), and INPUTS TO THE PROGRAM are the line-by-line inputs to the tic-tac-toe program.

For example:

Test case *test1.txt* contains:

```
1
0
0
1
1
0
2
2
1
0
1
y
2
1
0
0
0
1
1
0
1
1
2
n
```

and the output of `python test.pyc tictactoe test1.txt` is:

```
game 0 test: PASSED
game 1 test: PASSED
```

*The script has only been tested on `sc.rc.usf.edu`. Use at your own risk.
